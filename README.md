# DL523-Final-Project-YOLOR
Our task will be to implement the implicit knowledge capabilities from the paper “You Only Learn One Representation: Unified Network for Multiple Tasks” on the Faster R-CNN MobileNetV3-Large FPN network. We would be creating a baseline basic object detection and image classification network, then we will apply this paper which includes an implicit neural network and compare the performance between the two.
